Brief Overview:
Before you can use the Docker-Container,
you must first build the container with :
	docker-compose build

The first time it will take awhile to complete,
once it completes, you start the container with
	docker-compose up

To test the api, open another terminal, and run the
test script just like anyother python file. Alternatively
you can also test it with curl or postman. Thats it!
